Read-Credential  -Environment <String[]> [-Path <String>] [<CommonParameters>]  #  reads credentials from disk
Read-Credential  [-Path <String>] -ListAvailable [<CommonParameters>]           #  lists all available credentials

Security notes

Even if administrators or other users do have access to credentials files (i.e. on a network shares), they will not be able to decrypt it.
Function is using ConvertTo-SecureString with -AsPlainText parameter to process Username parameter which is by default passed as plain text. It is saved as encrypted data to disk.

Examples

Write-Credential Dev                 # User is prompted for credentials (user name and password) which are saved to default location
Write-Credential BAcc -Path P:\cred  # User is prompted for credentials for B account, which are afterwards saved to P: disk

$Cred = Read-Credential -Environment Dev                                                  # Gets username and password from files saved in repository and saves it in variable
Get-WMIObject Win32_Service -Computer DC1 -Credential (Read-Credential -Environment Dev)  # Gets credentials from repository and directly uses it in network operation
Get-Item '\\dfs\restricted\*' -Credential (Read-Credential -Environment BAcc)             # Gets B account credentials from repository and directly uses it to access restricted folder content
